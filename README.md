###[Overview](https://bitbucket.org/dynestudio/c4d-viewport-colors/wiki/Home#markdown-header-overview)   
Viewport Colors is a scripts package for C4D to improve your viewport workflow. With these scripts you can quickly apply different type of colors to your objects in the viewport for reference purposes without losing your C4D materials or 3rd party render engine materials.   

**VP Custom Color**   

With VP Custom Color you can add a custom color that you prefer to one or more selected objects (support one object, multiple objects and type of objects with they childrens too).   

**VP Direct Color**   

The VP Direct Color is for a more quickly and direct workflow, you can apply one color from a preset color library to one or more selected objects (support one object, multiple objects and type of objects with they childrens too).   

**Limitations**   

You can't have a children solid/transparent inside of a wireframe parent because c4d doesn't support different type of visualizations from children objects when the parent have a display tag.   

**The package include:**   

-VP Custom Color scripts.   
-VP Direct Color scripts.   
-User guide for both scripts packages.   
-7 explainer tutorials.
